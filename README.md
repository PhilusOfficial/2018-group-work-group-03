## **About**

**CLARINETTO** is a musical project built in p5.js for the course Creative Coding at the Politecnico di Milano. The main idea is to show how the instrument functions and produces sounds.

## **Idea**

The main goal was to create something related to music. After choosing an instrument we had a brainstorming about what to present and how to present it. At the end, we decided to create and provide some basic but useful information. With our project one can learn about parts of the clarinet, the production of the sound and even to virtually play the clarinet.

## **Graphics**

Clarinet itself is very complex so we wanted to present it as simple and as elegant as possible, but still showing all important details. Every drawing of it is designed in Illustrator and Photoshop, but the notes are drawn in p5.js.

## **Design challenge**

Even though we wanted to have as many interactions as possible, we knew that we had to choose what suits our project. Lastly, we decided to make interactions with the mouse, keyboard and the microphone.

 ## **Code challenge**

We expanded and explored the code that we were familiar with. We came across several problems with every part or page which primarily drove us crazy, but at the end it wasnâ€™t anything that we could not fix.
